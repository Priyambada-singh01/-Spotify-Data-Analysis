## 🎵 Spotify Data Analysis

### 📘 **Overview**

This project explores **Spotify music data** to uncover insights about tracks, artists, and genres. Using Python and data visualization, we analyze trends in song popularity, audio features (like energy, danceability, and tempo), and relationships between attributes to understand what makes a song successful.

---

### 🚀 **Project Goals**

* Analyze song trends and characteristics.
* Identify correlations between **audio features** and **popularity**.
* Visualize distributions of Spotify metrics such as **tempo, energy, valence, danceability**, etc.
* Build insights that could help **music producers, listeners, or playlist curators**.

---

### 📊 **Key Insights**

* Popular songs tend to have **high energy and danceability** scores.
* **Valence** (musical positivity) correlates with listener engagement.
* Genres with moderate tempo and balanced loudness are often **most popular globally**.
